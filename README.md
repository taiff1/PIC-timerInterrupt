# PIC-timerInterrupt
A simple demonstration of creating a timer interrupt based blinking of an LED connected to RD7. A switch on RB7 is then used to incrementally reduce the period of the LED blinking by 100ms for each press. When the period reaches less than 100ms, the period is then reset back to default (1 second).
